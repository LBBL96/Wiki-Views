# Wiki-Views
With this Python script you can create a WikiViews object taking a person's name as the parameter that holds information about their Wikipedia page's views over the past 60 days pulled from Wikipedia's page view API.

In addition to methods for getting a sum of views over periods ranging from a day to two months, methods include `max_views`, which returns the date with the highest number of views over past 60 days along with the number of views, and `plot_two_months`, which produces a time-series plot of views over the prior sixty days.
